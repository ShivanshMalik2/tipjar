A simple scenario for a XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) Attack
1. You are on a messaging site, You are communicating with strangers in a chat group.
2. Suddenly, An unknown user sends a link which alias says "Click here and get free iPhone"
3. Now who dosen't wants an iPhone? You click on it and there, The attacker gets access to your data

What happens in before and background:
⚫ Attacker creates a malicious script, This can be keyloggers etc.
⚫ Attacker sends the script as a message in the chat group
⚫ You clicked on the link, And then the scripts starts their payloads in backgrounds and the hacker gets access to your data, Many malicious things can take the place
